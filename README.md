# Find My Weather(Weather-App-Project)
-Welcome to my weather app "Find My Weather". An App that I created in pure
vanilla javascript that can show you the weather anywhere in the world. Give a city
or enable HTML5 geolocation and you will recieve the current weather and
forcasting weather for the days ahead so you can prepare for your week. I created a
proxy backend server with Express JS to call the weather api from [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
to maintain security and confidentiality.
